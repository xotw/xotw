# Gabriel | GTM Engineer @ [Bulldozer](https://bulldozer.com)

Building growth infrastructure. Breaking things. Shipping daily.

## What I Do

**TAM Building** — Mapping markets, finding signals, qualifying at scale
**Lead Scoring & Scraping** — Clay workflows, enrichment pipelines, scoring models
**Automation** — n8n, custom scripts, whatever gets the job done
**Tool Building** — If it doesn't exist, I build it. Pirate mindset.

## Stack

```
Clay · n8n · Python · APIs · Webhooks · SQL
```

## Philosophy

```
Ship → Break → Learn → Iterate → Repeat
```

Pragmatism over perfection. Velocity over polish.
The best tool is the one that works *today*.
